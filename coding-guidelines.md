# CODING GUIDELINES

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Ensure all code runs on both Windows and macOS
- Do not include emojies in the code

## Testing

- Use virtual environment (venv) for Python

## Coding Style

- Try to make functions reusable, so I can more easily us the code in other projects/on other clients
- Prefer simple, clean code with minimal comments and human-readable code.
- Minimise the number of python packages by preferring standard libraries

## Documentation

- Update README.md after any changes that affect setup, usage, or features
- Make sure to keep the README.md short and consice
- The most important documentation is how to run and how to test

## Decision Making

- Ask for clarification on any ambiguous design decisions before proceeding
- Challenge my decisions if you spot potential issues or missed considerations
- If you are not 100% sure about your answer then tell me

## Response Format

- Keep explanations and plans concise
- I want to implement the code myself, but you are welcome to provide me the code snippets that needs implementing
