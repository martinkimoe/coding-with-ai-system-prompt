# CODING GUIDELINES

## Cross-Platform Compatibility:
- Ensure all code runs on both Windows and macOS
- Do not include emojies in the code
- Use virtual environments for Python

## Documentation:
- Update README.md after any changes that affect setup, usage, or features
- Make sure to keep the README.md short and consice
- The most important documentation is how to run and how to test

## Decision Making:
- Ask for clarification on any ambiguous design decisions before proceeding
- Challenge my decisions if you spot potential issues or missed considerations
